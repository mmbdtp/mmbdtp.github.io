title: Using tar and gzip for fun and profit

> Gzip (GNU zip) compression is a widely used file compression and decompression format and tool that reduces the size of files or data streams to save storage space or reduce data transfer times over a network. It was developed as part of the GNU project and is commonly found in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.

> `tar` is a command-line utility and a file format used for archiving and compressing files and directories. The term "tar" stands for "tape archive," refering to when data was stored on magnetic tapes. The `tar` utility is a commonly used tool for creating, extracting, and managing archive files in the tar format.

## Example files 
Make some example files for us to play with.

You can use any combination of these, or make your own. Make at least 3 files. You can use a terminal text editor like `vi` or `emacs`, but do not use the GUI text editor.

```bash
grep --help   > grep_help.txt
touch empty_file.txt
echo "This is some text" > sometext.txt
```

### Exercise 1: Creating files

**Create the some example file, as described above.** 

**What is `touch`? What does `touch` do if the file already exists?** 

**From the example above, What does the `>` do for the grep output?**

**What does `echo` do?**

**How can you view the contents of these files?**

## Using `gzip`
The remainered of this module will use the example files you've created to demonstrate how to use `gzip` and `tar`. `gzip` allows use to compress files, while `tar` allows us to group files together. Let's start with `gzip`.  `gzip` should be pre-installed. To check if you have `gzip` installed, open a terminal and run:

```bash
gzip --version
```
If it's not installed, (tell us!) but on other systems you can typically install it using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `brew`, etc.).

#### Compress a File

To compress a file using `gzip`, you can run the following command:

```bash
gzip filename
```

Replace `filename` with the name of the file you want to compress. This command will create a compressed file with the `.gz` extension, such as `filename.gz`.

#### Decompress a File

To decompress a `.gz` file, use the `gunzip` command:

```bash
gunzip filename.gz
```

This will restore the original file, removing the `.gz` extension.

#### Compression Options

- `-d` or `--decompress`: Decompress the specified file(s).
- `-c` or `--stdout`: Write compressed data to standard output (useful for piping data).
- `-k` or `--keep`: Keep the original file after compression (by default, the original file is removed).
- `-v` or `--verbose`: Display compression details.

#### Compressing and Decompressing with Piping

You can also use `gzip` and `gunzip` with pipes to compress and decompress data on the fly. For example, to compress the output of a command and save it to a file:

```bash
command_to_generate_data | gzip -c > compressed_data.gz
```

And to decompress and process data from a compressed file:

```bash
gunzip -c compressed_data.gz | command_to_process_data
```

### Exercise 2: Using `gzip`

**With the information above, and whatever else you can find via the internet, compress the files you created in Exercise 1.**

**Now reverse it by decompressing those files**

**What is the difference in size of the compressed files and the original files?**

**Can you compress one of the files while keeping the original (decompressed)?** 

**What happens to the file extension after compressing with `gzip`?**

**How can you view the contents of these files?**

**What is the difference between `|` and `>`?**

**Can you combine the steps in exercise 1 and 2, to create and compress a file in one step?**

This is difficult. Hint, use piping.

## Using tar

To use the `tar` command in a Linux or Unix-like operating system, you can perform various operations, such as creating archives, extracting files from archives, and more. Here's a basic explanation of how to use `tar` with some common operations:

#### Creating a Tar Archive

To create a tar archive, you typically use the `-c` (create) option, followed by the `-f` (file) option to specify the archive file's name. You also list the files and directories you want to include in the archive. For example:

```bash
tar -cvf archive.tar file1.txt file2.txt directory/
```

* `-c`: Create a new archive.
* `-v`: Verbose mode (optional, for displaying the progress).
* `-f archive.tar`: Specify the archive file name.
* `file1.txt file2.txt directory/`: List the files and directories to include in the archive.

#### Viewing the Contents of a Tar Archive

You can list the contents of a tar archive without extracting them using the `-t` (list) option:

```bash
tar -tvf archive.tar
```

- `-t`: List the contents of the archive.

#### Extracting Files from a Tar Archive

To extract files from a tar archive, you can use the `-x` (extract) option:

```bash
tar -xvf archive.tar
```

- `-x`: Extract files from the archive.

#### Extracting Files to a Specific Directory

You can specify the target directory for extraction using the `-C` (change directory) option:

```bash
tar -xvf archive.tar -C /path/to/target_directory
```

- `-C /path/to/target_directory`: Extract files to the specified directory.

#### Compressing Tar Archives

You can create compressed tar archives using the `gzip` or `bzip2` compression utilities. For example:

- To create a gzip-compressed tar archive: `tar -cvzf archive.tar.gz file1.txt file2.txt directory/`
- To create a bzip2-compressed tar archive: `tar -cvjf archive.tar.bz2 file1.txt file2.txt directory/`

To extract from compressed archives, you can use the `-z` option for gzip-compressed archives or the `-j` option for bzip2-compressed archives.

```bash
tar -xvzf archive.tar.gz
tar -xvjf archive.tar.bz2
```

### Exercise 3: Using `tar`

**With the information above, and whatever else you can find via the internet, bundle all the files you created in Exercise 1 into a tarball**

**Now reverse it by extracting those files**

**What is the difference in size of the `tar` file and the sum of the original files? Is this what you expected?**

**What is the difference in file name of the output file between directly compressing with `gzip` and using `tar`?**

**What is the purpose of the `-v` flag in the `tar` command.**

**Can you combine the steps in exercise 2 and 3, to create an archive and compress it in one step?**

i.e. create a `.tar.gz` file in one step. 

Hint. Ask Arnie:

**Try running `zcat` on this file, what does zcat do?**
