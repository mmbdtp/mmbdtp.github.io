title: Background to sequencing
---

The first half of this week will be dedicated to a hands-on unscripted run through how sequencing is actually done on the Illumina platform and using Oxford Nanopore. 

If you are not familiar with these techniologies you might want to take a look at these links before during and after the session to orientate yourself and contextualise what you are being taught. Also feel free to consult the Glossary for this week.
